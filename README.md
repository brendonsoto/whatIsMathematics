# What Is Mathematics -- Code

I'm on and off reading the book *What is Mathematics?* by Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins and thought I'd try to code some of the answers in Haskell since I'm learning that too!

The idea struck me as I reached the exercises in the first chapter. Some of them seemed a bit repetitive and, me being me, my laziness brought about the idea of programming the answers to some of these problems to prevent doing all of the work by hand. When I started this repo I had only finished Chapter 1 part 1. I'm still new to Haskell too so there are times when doing things by hand are easier than by programming, but hey! that's a way to learn right?

Plus, I feel that learning the two together provides a nice sense of cohesion. You learn how one can apply to the other and enhance both skills.

Anywho, this is my journey of learning Haskell and Mathematics.
